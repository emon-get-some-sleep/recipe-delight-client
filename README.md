Our unique design is sure to catch your eye, with a beautiful banner section featuring stunning imagery and engaging text. Our navbar makes navigation a breeze, with easy access to our Home page, Blog, and User Profile Picture. If you're not yet signed in, simply click the Login button to get started.

Our homepage is packed full of great features, including a Chef section with at least six talented Indian chefs for you to discover. Each card features the chef's picture, name, years of experience, number of recipes, likes, and a View Recipes button, so you can learn more about their culinary creations. We've also included two extra sections on the homepage to keep things fresh and interesting.

When you click on a chef's View Recipes button, you'll be taken to their dedicated Chef Recipes page, complete with a banner featuring their picture, bio/description, likes, years of experience, and number of recipes. Here you'll find a tabular display of their recipes, each including the recipe name, at least five ingredients, cooking method, rating, and a Favorite button. Clicking the Favorite button will trigger a toast message letting you know the recipe is now one of your favorites, and disabling the button.

We've also thought of everything when it comes to user accounts, with an easy-to-use registration page featuring fields for name, email, password, and photo URL. We don't enforce email verification, so you can get started right away. And if you encounter any errors, we've got you covered with helpful messages to guide you through the process.

Of course, no site would be complete without a 404 page, and we've included one with a fun picture to keep you smiling even if you've hit a dead end!

We're committed to providing a top-notch user experience, with responsive design that looks great on both mobile and desktop devices. And with our clean and organized code structure, you can be sure that our site is both reliable and easy to use. So why wait?
